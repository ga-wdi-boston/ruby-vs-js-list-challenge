# Ruby vs. JavaScript: List Challenge

List processing is a very common task in applied computer science. Ruby and
JavaScript both have good list processing facilities, but they differ quite a
bit. This challenge requires you to solve the same two problems in both Ruby and
JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

-   [JavaScript Array Methods](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/js-array-methods)
-   [Ruby Array Methods](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/ruby-arrays)

## Instructions

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
1.  Change into the new directory.
1.  Install dependencies.
1.  Create and checkout a new branch to work on.
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.

Starter code is available in [`lib/challenge.js`](lib/challenge.js),
[`lib/challenge.rb`](lib/challenge.rb), and, if you wish to do the bonus,
[`lib/challenge.py`](lib/challenge.py). A pull request is not required, but it
is necessary if you want a code review.

You may wish to refer to [FAQs](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/)
related to [forking,
cloning](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone).

## Requirements

Complete these exercises in both Ruby and JavaScript:

-   [True for Any?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/enumerable-magic-number-2-true-for-any)
-   [True for None?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/enumerable-magic-number-4-true-for-none)

Create an any? (JS: any) function that accepts an array and a block (JS: function), and returns true if the block (/function) returns true for any item in the array. If the array is empty, the function should return false.


## Bonus

Complete the previous exercises in Python. You will have to do this on your own,
outside of CodeWars, since these kata have not been translated.

Complete the following exercises in Ruby, JavaScript, and Python:

-   [True for Just One?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/enumerable-magic-number-5-true-for-just-one)
-   [True for All?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/enumerable-magic-number-1-true-for-all)

## Testing

To run tests for all challenge functions in each language:

| Language | Command |
| --- | --- |
| JavaScript | grunt test |
| Ruby | rake test |
| Python | python spec/challenge_spec.py -v |
